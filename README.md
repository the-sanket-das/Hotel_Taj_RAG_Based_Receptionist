## 🧩 Project Overview

**Hotel Taj AI Assistant** is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**–based chatbot built using **LangChain** and **Hugging Face models**.  
It allows users to ask **contextual, factual questions** about Hotel Taj — such as its menu, chef, events, or policies — and get responses generated from its official data file (`Hotel_Taj.txt`).

> 💬 The assistant retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base, augments the user’s question with that context, and generates accurate, explainable responses — all in real time.
